Throughout this book you may be find yourself repeating some of the same
tasks over and over again. Why not use the knowledge you gained to create
programs that help you as you work your way through? Here are some ideas
that you can do. I've also include my codes for these, but as always, I
encourage you to attempt to write some yourself first! You may come up
with a much better code than I use.


1) Do you answer the practice questions at the end of each chapter in 
the book? Personally, I like to create a new Python file in Pycharm so
everything is organized. Copying and pasting the questions into an IDE 
will cause it to not be very readable since it will show all the "errors."

See if you can write a code that takes the clipboard after copying all 
the questions, deletes the Q, and just leaves the numbers with the questions 
as well as adding # before each line to comment it out. This way it's readable 
in the IDE, then if you want to execute code to answer the question you can
do so without a problem. 

See 'Practice Questions' for my solution


2) Since I use an IDE I organize each chapter into a new new project. This means
every file in each project will be set to that working directly unless specified.
There are some programs I actually want to keep and run at a later time without
wanting to go into the directory. I created a new folder called 'MyPythonScripts'
that stores all of these. I also set my Environmental Variables to include that
path so I can use Win+R to run these programs. Appendix B will show you how to 
do this. This means you also need to create a .bat file for each program you 
want to run. 

Write a program that automatically copies a .py file, moves it into a specific 
directory of your choosing, and automatically creates a .bat file so you don't
have to do this manually every time.

See 'Py Copy' for my solution.

3) This course contains a few zip files. You will probably get multiple other zip
files as well. Write a program to zip your a file to a specific location.
