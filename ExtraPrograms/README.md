Throughout this book you may be find yourself repeating some of the same
tasks over and over again. Why not use the knowledge you gained to create
programs that help you as you work your way through? Here are some ideas
that you can do. I've also include my codes for these, but as always, I
encourage you to attempt to write some yourself first! You may come up
with a much better code than I use.


1) Do you answer the practice questions at the end of each chapter in 
the book? Personally, I like to create a new Python file in Pycharm so
everything is organized. Copying and pasting the questions into an IDE 
will cause it to not be very readable since it will show all the "errors."

See if you can write a code that takes the clipboard after copying all 
the questions, deletes the Q, and just leaves the numbers with the questions 
as well as adding # before each line to comment it out. This way it's readable 
in the IDE, then if you want to execute code to answer the question you can
do so without a problem. 

See practice_questions.py for my solution
